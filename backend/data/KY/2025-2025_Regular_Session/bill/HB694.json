that if the actuarial funding level of the TRS retiree health fund falls below 95%, then the employer funding shall be restored to the retiree health fund until the retiree health fund is 100% funded; amend KRS 161.540, 161.550, and 161.675 to provide that the TRS board of trustees shall not recommend changes to the General Assembly to reduce employee or employer funding for retiree health or reduce board adopted charges under the shared responsibility provisions for health benefits for retirees under the age of 65 until the pension and retiree health funds are each 100% funded; amend KRS
